/**
 * DiscoverApartmenteryDeleteAction.gs
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * READ-ONLY diagnostic. Does NOT delete anything — only fetches pages
 * (GET requests) already known to work via _apartmenteryFetch_ and scans
 * the returned HTML for signals of a delete/cancel/destroy action:
 * forms, links, buttons, data-* attributes, onclick handlers, CSRF token
 * field names.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: ApartmenteryClient.gs has createApartmenteryBooking,
 * updateApartmenteryBookingEndDate, createApartmenteryInvoice,
 * createApartmenteryReceipt — but genuinely no delete function anywhere
 * (checked the full 1139-line file). Writing a delete call without seeing
 * a real request first means guessing the URL/method/form fields against
 * production, which is a bad idea. This script finds the real thing
 * instead — no browser devtools needed, since Apps Script already has the
 * live session cookie stored in Script Properties.
 *
 * I (Claude) cannot run this myself — apartmentery.com is not in my
 * sandbox's allowed network domains, and APARTMENTERY_SESSION lives only
 * in your Script Properties, not in the repo. You need to run this from
 * the Apps Script editor.
 *
 * HOW TO USE:
 *   1. Add this file to the loft-booking-invoice-todo Apps Script project
 *      (same project ApartmenteryClient.gs is already in).
 *   2. Pick a bookingId with NO invoice yet — the safest thing to
 *      inspect, since nothing protected by the hard rule is at risk if
 *      something unexpected happens. Get one via:
 *        - Sheet1's "Apartmentery Booking ID" column, cross-checked
 *          against invoice_apt_ids_v1 having no entry for it (i.e. exactly
 *          the isBookingIdInvoiced_() check in RoomMove.gs returning
 *          false), OR
 *        - just look in apartmentery.com's calendar for a booking you
 *          know hasn't been invoiced yet.
 *   3. In the Apps Script editor, select discoverBookingDeleteAction_ in
 *      the function dropdown... actually it takes arguments, so instead
 *      run the wrapper below: edit TEST_ROOM / TEST_BOOKING_ID at the top
 *      of runDiscoverDeleteActionForTestBooking(), then run THAT function.
 *   4. Check View > Logs (or View > Executions) for the report. Send me
 *      what it finds — especially any URL containing "delete", "destroy",
 *      "cancel", or "remove", and any CSRF/token field name+value it
 *      lists — and I'll wire up the real delete function.
 *   5. This makes GET requests only. It does not submit any form. It is
 *      safe to run against a real, live booking.
